# Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer.

## Challenge
Create a linked list that contain insert method that add a value to the head of the linked list and contain an insert method thats take a value and search in the linked list if it's inside return True if not return False 

## Approach & Efficiency
1. **`insert method`** :
   * time : O(1)
   * space : O(1)
2. **`includes method`** :
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)
3. **`__str__ method`** :
   * time : O(n)
   * space : O(1)

## API
1. **`insert method`** :

```
Add a new value to the beginning of the list (to the head)
```

2. **`includes method`** :

```
Search for a value in the linked list and return True if the value found and False if not found
```

3. **`__str__ method`** :

```
Print the linked list from the head to the end of Null
```
